# in the first step it will divide the array into two sections left and right and it will take the left and it will divide it into anther two array left and right and the same thing with the right array and it will keep doing that until reach arr.length smaller or equal 1 .

# after dividing the array into small picecs of array it will compare each element togther if the second is smaller than the first  it  will take its palces  .

# in the 3rd trail, it will get back one step from the recursion function and compare the left array elements with the right array elements one and replace their places.

# in the 4th trail, it will get back another step from the recursion function and compare the left array elements with the right array elements  and replace their places .
