# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
### this challenge requires to create a stacks and queues and this data structure approach should include 
- push
- pop
- isEmpty
- peek
- enqueue
- dequeue
- isEmpty
- peek
## Approach & Efficiency
### we implement in this code challenge stacks and queues and all it's method has Big O(1) space and Big O(1)time
- Push : Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.
- Pop : Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top : This is the top of the stack.
- Peek : When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Enqueue : Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front : This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear : This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek : When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
