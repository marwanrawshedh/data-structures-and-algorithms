# Challenge Summary
## this challenge is asking to create a Singly Linked Lists that contain (kthFromEnd)methode this method take one parameter(k) which Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the list , but it keep running from the end .

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- Singly Linked Lists why? it is a simple data structur time:  Big O =O(n)
space:  Big O =O(1)
