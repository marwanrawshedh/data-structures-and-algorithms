# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
i created a Singly Linked List include a value and net point with three methode allow me to insert node search for a value reprsent all list's values .

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## this challenge is asking to create a Singly Linked Lists that contain a insert method (which allows us to add a new node ),includes method (This allows us to search for a value and return true if it exists or false if it isn't)and a toString method (that return a string representing all the values in the Linked List)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Singly Linked Lists why? it is a simple data structur  Big O =O(n)
## API
- insert method: it is a method take a value which allows us to Add a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance. 
- includes method:it is a method take a value which  allows us to search for a value and return true if  exist or false if it is not
- toString method:it is a method doesnt take any Arguments which return a string representing all the values in the Linked List as a string formatted as:"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL".

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked listVenus
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
