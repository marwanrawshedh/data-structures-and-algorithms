# Hashtables
 
## Approach & Efficiency
- big o time of read is O(1)
- space O(n)
## API
- getHash :function take one parameter return the input as a number as an index
- add: action will add new node have value and next
- get: function takes one parameter return a certain value 
- contains :function take one parameter return boolean that indicates if the value exists or not
# test
- [x] Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
- [x] Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
- [x] Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
- [x] Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
- [x] Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
